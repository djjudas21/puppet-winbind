## Overview

Puppet module to add Linux machines to a Windows domain using Winbind

## Module Description

Puppet module to add Linux machines to a Windows Active Directory domain using Winbind.
As this module fiddles with `smb.conf` it is not compatible with any other module
that affects Samba operations.

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing
the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You may also add any additional sections you feel are
necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
